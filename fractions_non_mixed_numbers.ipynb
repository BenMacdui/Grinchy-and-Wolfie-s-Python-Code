        "Fractions are really ratios and 2/3 could be written also as 2:3 (2 parts out of 3)\n",
        "The numerator is the number above the line, in 2/3 the numerator is 2\n",
        "and the denominator is the bottom number, in 2/3 it is 3. \n",
        "\n",
        "Adding: We can only add fractions with the same denominator. If these are different\n",
        "we need to find the least common denominator first. For example 2/3 + 2/4 we multiply 3*4 to \n",
        "find the least common denominator which is 12. \n",
        "\n",
        "We had to multiply the denominator of 2/3 by 4 to get 12, so we multiply the \n",
        "numerator of 2/3 by 4 also which equals 8. This gives us 8/12. And we do the same\n",
        "with the other fraction\n",
        "We multiply the denominator of the fraction 2/4 by 3 in order to get 12,\n",
        "and the nominator of 2/4 by 3 which gives us 6 so we get 6/12. \n",
        "\n",
        "Now we can add both fractions together as the both have the same denominator,\n",
        "namely 12: So we write 8/12 + 6/12 = 14/12. Simplifying the fraction we write:\n",
        "14/12 = 7/6 = 1 1/6\n",
        "\n",
        "Substracting: This is just the same as above only that we substract the nominators after we have found\n",
        "the least common denominator\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiplication: Here we multiply the nominators of the numbers and the denominators of the numbers.\n",
        "In algebra this is written as a/b * c/d = ac/bd or with numbers 1/3 * 2/5 = 1*2/3*5 = 2/15\n",
        "\n",
        "Division: In division we multiply the fraction by it's reciprocital \n",
        "(we turn the second fraction upside down)\n",
        "Since we love algebra so much we write this as a/b / c/d = a/b * d/c \n",
        "This reads a over b divided by c over d equals a over b times d over c\n",
        "Written in numbers 2/3 / 1/2 = 2/3 * 2/1 = 2*2/3*1 = 4/3 = 1 1/3\n",
        "\n",
        "Mixed numbers: When we have mixed numbers we turn them first into improper fractions:\n",
        "So for example 5 2/10 is turned into the improper fraction 52/10. \n",
        "\n",
        "This is done as follows the whole number 5 is written as a fraction 5/1 \n",
        "to which we add 2/10. We now have to find the least common denominator as we have\n",
        "seen above we cannot add fractions that do not have a common denominator\n",
        "In order to find the least common denominator we just multiply by the denominator of the \n",
        "fraction part which is 10 (fraction part is 2/10, remember). We get:\n",
        "1 * 10 and 5 * 10 = 50/10 \n",
        "Now we can add 2/10 = 52/10. \n",
        "\n",
        "In the program snippet of Mixed numbers I just multiply the denominator of the fraction\n",
        "with the whole number and add the numerator of the fraction to that.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although my program can do exponentials and square roots of fractions I don't think\n",
        "that will come up in S1 and S2 but if and when it does we will add this part\n",
        "\n",
        "So now that we know how fractions work we can write a program to do the calculation for us\n",
